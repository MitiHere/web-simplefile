# web-simplefile

A weird try on file hosting service, with a simple site where you can share a file, and download it with a qr code to your phone, right now it is really not secure, because anyone can change the file how they want but anyone can also download the file.

You can see the service here : https://fupload.ceyraud.com/

## Todo

- link to a MAPI to protect the upload behind a logged page
- create a random uid for the current file, and you can only download it if you have the uuid for this file
- create a timer for how long the file is accessible
- maybe upgrade from one file to one file per user ?

## Question

Is it an issue if everyone can download the file ?
